To run the script, first insert all your .LHE files into the folder "lhefiles"
	These need to be in the format events_50k_1.lhe, where 50k is the number of events, and 1 is the file number (increase this by 1 for every extra file of that size)


cd into scripts/


Edit the second line of the bash scripts "events_50k.sh" and "events_100k.sh" to enter how many .LHE files of that size you have. Also create new scripts for other size LHE files (ie 500k, 1M, etc.)
	If you added new bash scripts, edit the main bash script "RUN.sh" and add new root -b -l -q ... lines for each new script.


type the following commands:
	chmod +x RUN.sh
	./RUN.sh

This will run the program, and output PDF's of all the graphs (located in the "output folder"), as well as a new tree.root file for re-plotting (use the MACRO lheplot.C to re-plot)
